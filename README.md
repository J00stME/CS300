What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  This course provided us with the tools needed to understand the manipulation of data.  Data can be stored and mutated in many different ways, known as data structures and algorithms respectively.  I learned some of the most   commonly used solutions to this problem such as sorting algorithms and Abstract Data Types.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  The goal of these ADT's is that the end user need only understand the structure and not the inner workings.  For the developer this means weighing the cost effectiveness of different data structures and algorithms through     their runtime and memory complexity.  Knowing these two things will shape the way we create different solutions.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  Some of the biggest challenges I faced involved C++ syntax.  Luckily for me there are thousands of resources for any kind of issue one might have, and the base libraries of C++ are extremely well documented.  Passing by reference rather than passing a copy, for example, is an important principle for manipulating data.  Misuse of this concept could end up with you modifying a reference to an object rather than the object itself.  Rage ensues.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  Throughout my coding experience, everything I learn becomes part of my toolbox.  As I learn the tricks of the trade, I add them to this toolbox.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  It isn't our job as developers to reinvent the wheel every time we write a program.  That being said, it is good practice to archive one's code for refactoring/reuse down the line.  Documenting this code or even simply   commenting will offer insight to your future self or other fellow software engineers.

Thank you for your time
